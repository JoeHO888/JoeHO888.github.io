Hello,
I'm Joe, I'm working in a Multinational Company as a IT professional. My fulltime job covers lots of areas as below,

* SharePoint Online (Administration, Architecture Design, New Feature Testing, Support)
* Development on Internal Tools (e.g. Internal Learning Portal, Recuitment Portal) with Office 365 products (SharePoint Online, Microsoft Flow, PowerApps,etc)
* [OCS-NG](https://www.ocsinventory-ng.org/en/ "A link") Architecture Design and Support
* [Windows DHCP Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/technologies/dhcp/dhcp-top "A link") Suport and Upgrade
* [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com "A link") Dashboard and Application Support

In my leisure time, I learn software development, algorithms, system design, data science and networking. I will try my best to record the stuff I learnt and hope you enjoy! Besides, I'm a Competition Master in Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/joe1995](https://www.kaggle.com/joe1995 "A link")
