In the past, I thought I mastered some new technologies, knowledge after watching a bunch of videos and reading articles until I found that I still didn't know how to apply these skills in a real challenge. After that, I started doing different kind of projects, either for fun or for learning purpose.

Below are projects I have worked on and well-documented.
